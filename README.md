## Ralph Integration

The toolkit integrates key concepts from [Ralph](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code) and the [Ralph Playbook](https://github.com/ClaytonFarr/ralph-playbook) — an autonomous AI development methodology by Geoffrey Huntley.

### Autonomous Loop (`/ralph` or `/loop`)

Iterative development cycle: **PLANNING** → **BUILDING** → **STATUS CHECK** → repeat until done.

- **ONE task per loop** — each iteration selects and completes exactly one task
- **Context efficiency** — main context at 40-60% utilization, up to 500 parallel read subagents
- **Upstream/downstream steering** — specs shape inputs, tests/builds/lints create backpressure
- **Dual-condition exit gate** — requires both completion language AND explicit `EXIT_SIGNAL: true`

### Circuit Breaker

Safety mechanism preventing infinite loops and resource exhaustion:

- Opens after 3 loops with no progress, 5 identical errors, or 70% output decline
- 30-minute cooldown before retry
- Rate limiting (configurable calls per hour)
- File protection prevents accidental config deletion

### JTBD Specifications (`/specs`)

Jobs to Be Done methodology for writing implementation-free specs:

- Break requirements into topics of concern
- "One Sentence Without 'And'" test for proper scoping
- Acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
- SLC (Simple/Lovable/Complete) release planning

### Acceptance Testing & LLM-as-Judge

- **Acceptance testing** — backpressure chain: specs → tests → code (fix code, not specs)
- **LLM-as-judge** — structured rubric evaluation for subjective criteria (tone, UX, readability)

---

## Installation

### Modes

| Mode | Directory | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Plugin** (default) | `.claude-plugin/` | Isolated, portable, easy to update |
| **Direct** | `.claude/` | Merged into existing Claude Code config |

### Scope

| Scope | Path | Use Case |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Project** (default) | `./.claude/` or `./.claude-plugin/` | Per-project setup |
| **Global** | `~/.claude/` or `~/.claude-plugin/` | Available everywhere |

### Interactive vs CLI

```bash
# Interactive wizard (recommended)
npx @pixelandprocess/superkit-agents

# Full install, no prompts
npx @pixelandprocess/superkit-agents --all

# Global plugin install
npx @pixelandprocess/superkit-agents --all --global

# Direct install (no plugin wrapper)
npx @pixelandprocess/superkit-agents --all --direct

# Selective skills
npx @pixelandprocess/superkit-agents --skills planning,tdd,code-review,autonomous-loop
```

---

## Update

Check for updates and get the latest version:

```bash
superkit-agents update
```

This checks the npm registry for newer versions and provides upgrade instructions. Your installation preferences are automatically saved and reused on update.

---

## Laravel Detection

When running in a Laravel project directory (detected via `composer.json`), superkit-agents automatically:

1. Detects the Laravel framework dependency
2. Prompts to install **Laravel Boost** (`composer require laravel/boost`) for performance optimization
3. Auto-selects `laravel-specialist`, `php-specialist`, and `laravel-boost` skills

---

## CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--all` | Install everything non-interactively |
| `--global` | Install to `~/.claude/` instead of `./.claude/` |
| `--plugin` | Install as a `.claude-plugin/` plugin |
| `--direct` | Install directly into `.claude/` directories |
| `--skills <list>` | Comma-separated list of skills to install |
| `--no-hooks` | Skip hooks installation |
| `--no-memory` | Skip memory structure creation |
| `--no-claude-md` | Skip CLAUDE.md generation |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be installed without making changes |

---

## Hooks & Session Start

The toolkit installs a `hooks.json` that triggers on Claude Code session events:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "startup|resume|clear|compact",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "'${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/session-start'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

On every session start, resume, clear, or compact:
1. The `using-toolkit` skill is loaded into context
2. Memory files (`project-context.md`, `learned-patterns.md`, `user-preferences.md`) are injected
3. Claude Code receives the toolkit's full skill catalog and workflow guidance

---

## Memory System

Four persistent memory files store project knowledge across sessions:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `project-context.md` | Tech stack, architecture, dependencies |
| `learned-patterns.md` | Coding conventions and patterns |
| `user-preferences.md` | Communication and workflow preferences |
| `decisions-log.md` | Architectural decisions with rationale |
| `improvement-log.md` | Self-improvement tracking and effectiveness metrics |

- Auto-loaded on session start via the session-start hook
- Updated by the `self-learning` skill (`/learn`)
- Persists across conversations for continuity

---

## CLAUDE.md Merge Behavior

When installing, the toolkit handles existing `CLAUDE.md` files safely:

- Wraps toolkit content in `<!-- TOOLKIT START -->` / `<!-- TOOLKIT END -->` markers
- Backs up existing `CLAUDE.md` before modifying
- Preserves all user content outside the markers
- Re-running the installer updates only the toolkit section

---

---

## Configuration & Customization

### Selective Skill Installation

Install only the skills you need:

```bash
npx @pixelandprocess/superkit-agents --skills planning,tdd,code-review,autonomous-loop
```

Or use the interactive wizard to pick categories and individual skills.

### Custom Skills

Add your own skills alongside toolkit ones. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.claude/skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md
```

### Find More Skills

When the toolkit's 64 skills don't cover your needs:

```bash
npx skills find [query]                    # Search the ecosystem
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y    # Install
npx skills check                           # Check for updates
```

---

## Skill Format Reference

Skills use markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does (one line)
triggers:
  - keyword or phrase that activates this skill
  - another trigger phrase
---

## Purpose
What this skill accomplishes.

## Process
Step-by-step instructions Claude follows when this skill is invoked.

## Output
What the skill produces.
```

The `name` and `description` fields are required. `triggers` help Claude identify when to use the skill automatically.
